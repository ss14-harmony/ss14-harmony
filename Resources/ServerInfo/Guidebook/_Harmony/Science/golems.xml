  Golems are servants to their creators, that are immune to spacing and fire, having special properties depending on the material you use to make them.

  ## Steps to making a Golem
  - First, make a base Golem core from a anomaly core in the construction menu
  - Then, add ten material of your choice to make a custom golem core.
  - Interact with it to call out for a host to take its body.
